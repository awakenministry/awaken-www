    Fr. Mathias challenged God for signs that he should become a priest,
    and when they came, he said "no" because he'd just met the girl of his dreams,
    was a high school baseball pitcher and always wanted a wife and children. When
    he finally surrendered to God and  made what he says was the hardest decision
    of his life, there were some family and friends, even his mother, who thought
    he wouldn't be happy not being married. Now they all see how truly happy he is
    being a priest. Fr. Mathias has become known for sharing the gift of healing
    prayer and his passion for the gospel of Jesus, Christ!

    Once a fallen away Catholic, Fr. Patrick experienced a great conversion in his life,
    which not only led him back to the Catholic faith, but into the priesthood! He has a
    passion for seeing God at work in the lives of others, especially "bringing home"
    the lost, whom he says he identifies very well with! He is a bright and shining light
    for Christ in our world today, extremely popular among youth and young adults, and
    loved by all ages. He now serves as Associate Pastor of the Cathedral Cluster, consisting
    of The Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament, St. Moses the Black Parish and Our
    Lady of the Rosary Parish.

    called a "revert" to the faith. He was raised Catholic, but his family left the Catholic

    as an Evangelical Protestant, Fr. Steve returned to the Catholic Church, and later
    felt the call to the priesthood; he is passionate about his love for Jesus and his
    Catholic faith. Come and be inspired in your faith by Fr. Steve!
